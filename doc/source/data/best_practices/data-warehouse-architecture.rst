        "SELECT * FROM transactions", 
        snowflake_connection
    )
    customer_images = ray.data.read_images("s3://customer-photos/")
    
    # Advanced multimodal processing

            lambda batch: extract_text_insights(batch)
        )
        
        # Combine and enhance
        combined_data = bigquery_data.join(processed_text, on="event_id")
        enhanced_data = combined_data.map_batches(
            lambda batch: apply_advanced_analytics(batch)
        )

Advanced Warehouse Analytics Patterns
--------------------------------------

**Implement sophisticated analytics patterns that extend beyond traditional warehouse capabilities.**

**Multimodal Customer Analytics**

Transform traditional customer analytics by incorporating unstructured data sources alongside structured transaction data:

.. code-block:: python

    def multimodal_customer_analytics():
        """Comprehensive customer analytics with multimodal data."""
        # Traditional structured data
        transactions = ray.data.read_sql(
            "SELECT * FROM customer_transactions", 
            warehouse_connection
        )
        
        # Unstructured data sources
        customer_emails = ray.data.read_text("s3://customer-emails/")
        support_calls = ray.data.read_audio("s3://support-recordings/")
        
        # Advanced processing
        def analyze_customer_sentiment(batch):
            """Analyze customer sentiment across all touchpoints."""
            # Email sentiment analysis
            batch['email_sentiment'] = analyze_text_sentiment(batch['email_content'])
            
            # Call sentiment analysis
            batch['call_sentiment'] = analyze_audio_sentiment(batch['audio_path'])
            
            # Combined customer health score
            batch['customer_health'] = calculate_health_score(batch)
            
            return batch
        
        # Comprehensive customer view
        customer_360 = transactions.join(customer_emails, on="customer_id") \
            .join(support_calls, on="customer_id") \
            .map_batches(analyze_customer_sentiment)
        
        return customer_360

**Real-Time Warehouse Updates**

Implement near real-time warehouse updates using Ray Data's incremental processing capabilities:

.. code-block:: python

    def real_time_warehouse_updates():
        """Near real-time warehouse updates with Ray Data."""
        # Detect new data since last update
        last_update = get_last_update_timestamp()
        
        new_data = ray.data.read_sql(
            f"SELECT * FROM events WHERE created_at > '{last_update}'",
            source_connection
        )
        
        # Process incremental updates
        processed_updates = new_data.map_batches(
            lambda batch: apply_business_logic(batch),
            batch_size=5000
        )
        
        # Merge with warehouse
        processed_updates.write_snowflake(
            table="real_time_metrics",
            mode="append",
            connection_parameters=warehouse_config
        )
        
        # Update timestamp tracking
        update_last_processed_timestamp()

Performance Optimization Strategies
-----------------------------------

**Optimize warehouse performance through intelligent data preparation and workload distribution.**

**Query Performance Optimization**

Prepare data specifically for warehouse query patterns to minimize compute costs and maximize performance:

.. code-block:: python

    def optimize_for_warehouse_queries():
        """Optimize data preparation for warehouse query performance."""
        raw_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://raw-data/")
        
        # Apply warehouse-specific optimizations
        def warehouse_optimization(batch):
            """Optimize data for warehouse consumption."""
            # Sort by common query columns
            batch = batch.sort_values(['date', 'customer_id'])
            
            # Pre-calculate common aggregations
            batch['monthly_total'] = batch.groupby('month')['amount'].transform('sum')
            batch['customer_rank'] = batch.groupby('date')['amount'].rank(method='dense')
            
            # Optimize data types for warehouse performance
            batch = optimize_data_types_for_warehouse(batch)
            
            return batch
        
        optimized_data = raw_data.map_batches(warehouse_optimization)
        
        # Write with warehouse-optimized partitioning
        optimized_data.write_parquet(
            "s3://warehouse-optimized/",
            partition_cols=["year", "month"],
            compression="snappy"
        )

**Cost Management Strategies**

Implement intelligent cost management that balances warehouse compute costs with processing requirements:

* **Workload classification**: Automatically classify workloads and route to appropriate processing platforms
* **Cost monitoring**: Track processing costs across Ray Data and warehouse platforms
* **Optimization automation**: Automatically adjust processing distribution based on cost-performance metrics
* **Resource scheduling**: Schedule compute-intensive work during low-cost periods

Enterprise Warehouse Architecture
----------------------------------

**Design enterprise-grade warehouse architectures that meet security, compliance, and governance requirements.**

**Security and Compliance Integration**

Integrate Ray Data processing with warehouse security models to maintain consistent access controls and audit trails:

.. code-block:: python

    def secure_warehouse_processing(user_context):
        """Apply security controls in warehouse processing."""
        # Apply row-level security based on user context
        def apply_security_filters(batch):
            """Filter data based on user permissions."""
            if not user_context.has_global_access():
                # Filter to authorized regions
                authorized_regions = user_context.get_authorized_regions()
                batch = batch[batch['region'].isin(authorized_regions)]
            
            # Add audit trail
            batch['accessed_by'] = user_context.user_id
            batch['access_timestamp'] = datetime.now()
            
            return batch
        
        # Process with security controls
        secure_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://sensitive-data/") \
            .map_batches(apply_security_filters)
        
        return secure_data

**Governance and Lineage Tracking**

Maintain comprehensive data governance across Ray Data processing and warehouse storage:

* **Data lineage**: Track data flow from sources through Ray Data processing to warehouse tables
* **Quality monitoring**: Monitor data quality at each processing stage with automated alerting
* **Schema governance**: Manage schema evolution across processing and warehouse layers
* **Compliance reporting**: Generate compliance reports that span both processing and storage
