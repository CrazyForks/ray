Why Ray Data for Business Analytics?
------------------------------------

**Ray Data solves critical business analytics challenges:**

**Challenge #1: Analytics Performance at Scale**

Traditional BI tools struggle with large datasets and complex calculations. Ray Data provides 10x faster analytics processing with streaming aggregations.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray.data.aggregate import Sum, Count, Mean, Max, Min
    
    # High-performance business analytics
    # Load enterprise data from data warehouse
    sales_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://warehouse/sales-transactions/")
    customer_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://warehouse/customer-profiles/")
    
    # Complex business analytics with streaming execution
    customer_analytics = sales_data \
        .join(customer_data, key="customer_id") \
        .filter(lambda row: row["transaction_date"] >= "2024-01-01") \
        .groupby(["customer_segment", "region"]) \
        .aggregate(
            Sum("revenue"),                    # Total revenue per segment
            Count("transaction_id"),           # Transaction frequency
            Mean("order_value"),               # Average order value
            Max("transaction_date"),           # Latest activity
            Min("transaction_date")            # First activity
        )
    
    # Advanced customer segmentation
    def calculate_customer_ltv(batch):
        """Calculate customer lifetime value with business logic."""
        # Apply business rules for LTV calculation
        ltv_multipliers = {"premium": 3.5, "standard": 2.0, "basic": 1.2}
        
        batch["customer_ltv"] = [
            row["sum(revenue)"] * ltv_multipliers.get(row["customer_segment"], 1.0)
            for row in batch
        ]
        
        # Add risk scoring
        batch["risk_score"] = [
            calculate_risk_score(row) for row in batch
        ]
        
        return batch
    
    # Apply business intelligence transformations
    enriched_analytics = customer_analytics \
        .map_batches(calculate_customer_ltv, batch_size=1000)
    
    # Export for BI tool consumption
    enriched_analytics.write_parquet("s3://bi-data/customer-insights/")

**Challenge #2: BI Tool Integration Performance**

Ray Data optimizes data preparation for BI tools, ensuring fast dashboard loading and interactive analytics.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    # BI-optimized data preparation
    # Prepare data specifically for Tableau/Power BI consumption
    def prepare_for_tableau(batch):
        """Optimize data structure for Tableau performance."""
        # Flatten nested structures
        # Optimize data types for BI tools
        # Pre-calculate common aggregations
        
        optimized_batch = {
            "date": batch["transaction_date"],
            "revenue": batch["sum(revenue)"],
            "customer_count": batch["count(transaction_id)"],
            "avg_order_value": batch["mean(order_value)"],
            "region": batch["region"],
            "segment": batch["customer_segment"]
        }
        
        return optimized_batch
    
    # BI-ready dataset
    tableau_data = enriched_analytics \
        .map_batches(prepare_for_tableau, batch_size=5000) \
        .repartition(10)  # Optimize for BI tool loading
    
    # Export in BI-optimized format
    tableau_data.write_parquet(
        "s3://bi-exports/tableau-customer-analytics/",
        filesystem=s3_filesystem,
        try_create_dir=False
    )
    
    # Also export to CSV for Excel/other tools
    tableau_data.write_csv("s3://bi-exports/excel-customer-analytics.csv")

**Challenge #3: Real-Time Analytics and Streaming**

Ray Data enables real-time analytics and streaming aggregations for live dashboards.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    # Real-time analytics pipeline
    def streaming_analytics():
        """Process streaming data for real-time dashboards."""
        
        # Simulate streaming data ingestion
        streaming_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://streaming/hourly-updates/")
        
        # Real-time aggregations
        hourly_metrics = streaming_data \
            .groupby(["hour", "region"]) \
            .aggregate(
                Sum("revenue"),
                Count("transactions"),
                Mean("customer_satisfaction")
            )
        
        # Update dashboard data
        hourly_metrics.write_parquet("s3://dashboards/real-time-metrics/")
        
        return hourly_metrics
    
    # Schedule for real-time updates
    real_time_results = streaming_analytics()
