Why Ray Data for AI/ML Engineering?
-----------------------------------

**Ray Data solves critical AI/ML engineering challenges:**

**Challenge #1: Multimodal Data Processing Complexity**

Traditional tools require separate systems for images, text, audio, and structured data. Ray Data processes all data types in unified pipelines.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    import torch
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

    # Unified multimodal processing pipeline
    # Load different data types
    customer_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://warehouse/customers/")
    product_images = ray.data.read_images("s3://content/product-images/")
    support_texts = ray.data.read_text("s3://support/chat-logs/")
    
    # Process structured data with business logic
    customer_features = customer_data \
        .map_batches(calculate_customer_metrics, batch_size=1000)
    
    # Process images with computer vision models
    def extract_image_features(batch):
        """Extract features using pre-trained vision model."""
        model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision', 'resnet50', pretrained=True)
        model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            features = model(batch["image"])
        return {"product_id": batch["product_id"], "image_features": features}
    
    image_features = product_images \
        .map_batches(
            extract_image_features,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=8),
            num_gpus=1.0,  # Full GPU per worker
            batch_size=32   # Optimized for GPU memory
        )
    
    # Process text with NLP models
    def extract_text_sentiment(batch):
        """Analyze sentiment using transformer models."""
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        
        # Tokenize and analyze sentiment
        tokens = tokenizer(batch["text"], padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = model(**tokens)
        sentiment_scores = torch.softmax(outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1), dim=-1)
        
        return {"support_id": batch["support_id"], "sentiment": sentiment_scores}
    
    text_sentiment = support_texts \
        .map_batches(
            extract_text_sentiment,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=4),
            num_gpus=0.5,  # Shared GPU for text processing
            batch_size=64
        )
    
    # Unified output for comprehensive analytics
    customer_features.write_parquet("s3://ml-features/customer-metrics/")
    image_features.write_parquet("s3://ml-features/product-vision/")
    text_sentiment.write_parquet("s3://ml-features/support-sentiment/")

**Challenge #2: GPU Resource Optimization**

Ray Data automatically optimizes GPU allocation across different model types and processing stages.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    # Mixed CPU/GPU pipeline with automatic optimization
    def cpu_preprocessing(batch):
        """CPU-intensive data cleaning and validation."""
        # Data cleaning, validation, normalization
        cleaned_data = validate_and_clean(batch)
        return cleaned_data
    
    def gpu_model_inference(batch):
        """GPU-intensive model inference."""
        # Load model on GPU for inference
        model = load_pretrained_model().cuda()
        predictions = model(batch["features"])
        return {"predictions": predictions.cpu().numpy()}
    
    # Intelligent resource allocation
    pipeline_result = raw_data \
        .map_batches(
            cpu_preprocessing,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=16),
            num_cpus=2,  # CPU-only preprocessing
            batch_size=1000
        ) \
        .map_batches(
            gpu_model_inference,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=8),
            num_gpus=1.0,  # Full GPU for inference
            batch_size=128  # GPU memory optimized
        )

**Production results:** Pinterest achieves 90%+ GPU utilization vs 25-40% with traditional ML platforms.

**Challenge #3: Framework Integration Complexity**

Ray Data integrates seamlessly with any AI framework while maintaining performance and scalability.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer
    
    # Seamless Ray ecosystem integration
    # Prepare training data with Ray Data
    training_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://training-data/") \
        .map_batches(preprocess_for_training, batch_size=256) \
        .random_shuffle()
    
    # Train model with Ray Train (seamless handoff)
    def train_func(config):
        # Training logic using preprocessed data
        model = create_model(config)
        # Ray Data â†’ Ray Train integration is automatic
        return train_model(model, training_data)
    
    trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_func,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=8, use_gpu=True),
        datasets={"train": training_data}  # Direct dataset passing
    )
    
    result = trainer.fit()
    
    # Deploy with Ray Serve (complete ecosystem)
    from ray import serve
    
    @serve.deployment(num_replicas=4, ray_actor_options={"num_gpus": 0.5})
    def model_endpoint(request):
        # Use trained model for serving
        return model.predict(request.json())
