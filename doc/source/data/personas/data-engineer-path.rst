Why Ray Data for Data Engineering?
----------------------------------

**Ray Data solves critical data engineering challenges:**

**Challenge #1: Memory Limitations with Large Datasets**

Traditional ETL tools fail when datasets exceed available memory. Ray Data's streaming execution processes any dataset size with constant memory usage.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray.data.aggregate import Sum, Count
    
    # Process petabyte-scale data with streaming execution
    large_dataset = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://warehouse/petabyte-data/")
    
    # Streaming pipeline - no memory bottlenecks
    result = large_dataset \
        .filter(lambda row: row["valid"]) \
        .map_batches(validate_and_enrich, batch_size=1000) \
        .groupby("partition_key") \
        .aggregate(Sum("amount"), Count("records")) \
        .write_parquet("s3://warehouse/processed/")
    
    # Handles any dataset size with constant memory usage

**Challenge #2: Complex Enterprise Integration**

Ray Data provides native connectivity to enterprise platforms without complex custom connectors.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    # Native enterprise platform connectivity
    # Load from Snowflake data warehouse
    snowflake_data = ray.data.read_sql(
        "SELECT * FROM customer_transactions WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'",
        connection_uri="snowflake://user:pass@account/database"
    )
    
    # Load from Unity Catalog
    unity_data = ray.data.read_delta_table("catalog.schema.product_data")
    
    # Join across platforms with distributed processing
    unified_data = snowflake_data.join(unity_data, key="product_id")
    
    # Export to BigQuery for analytics
    unified_data.write_bigquery("project.dataset.unified_analytics")

**Challenge #3: GPU Resource Optimization**

Ray Data automatically optimizes CPU and GPU resources within single pipelines for maximum efficiency.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    def gpu_intensive_processing(batch):
        """GPU-accelerated data transformation."""
        # Custom processing logic using GPU libraries
        import cudf  # GPU-accelerated pandas
        
        gpu_df = cudf.DataFrame(batch)
        processed = gpu_df.groupby("category").sum()
        return processed.to_dict("list")
    
    # Automatic GPU resource allocation
    processed_data = raw_data \
        .map_batches(
            gpu_intensive_processing,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=4),
            num_gpus=1.0,  # Full GPU per worker
            batch_size=10000  # Optimize for GPU memory
        )

**Production results:** Pinterest achieves 90%+ GPU utilization vs 25-40% with traditional tools.

Success Validation Checkpoints
-------------------------------

**Phase 1 Validation: Can you build a basic ETL pipeline?**

Build this pipeline to validate your foundation:

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray.data.aggregate import Sum, Count, Mean
    
    # Extract: Load from multiple sources
    sales_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://warehouse/sales/")
    customer_data = ray.data.read_sql(
        "SELECT * FROM customers", 
        connection_uri="postgresql://host/db"
    )
    
    # Transform: Business logic and data enrichment
    enriched_sales = sales_data \
        .join(customer_data, key="customer_id") \
        .filter(lambda row: row["amount"] > 0) \
        .map_batches(calculate_customer_metrics, batch_size=1000)
    
    # Load: Export to data warehouse
    enriched_sales.write_parquet("s3://warehouse/enriched-sales/")

**Expected outcome:** Successfully process business data with joins, filtering, and transformations.

**Phase 2 Validation: Can you integrate with enterprise platforms?**

Implement cross-platform data movement:

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    # Multi-platform integration
    snowflake_data = ray.data.read_snowflake("warehouse.schema.table")
    databricks_data = ray.data.read_delta_table("catalog.schema.table")
    
    # Unified processing
    unified_result = snowflake_data \
        .union(databricks_data) \
        .groupby("business_unit") \
        .aggregate(Sum("revenue"))
    
    # Export to BigQuery
    unified_result.write_bigquery("project.dataset.unified_metrics")

**Expected outcome:** Successfully move data between enterprise platforms.

**Phase 3 Validation: Can you optimize for production performance?**

Demonstrate performance optimization:

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    
    # Production-optimized pipeline
    optimized_pipeline = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://large-dataset/") \
        .map_batches(
            complex_transformation,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=16),
            num_cpus=2,
            batch_size=5000  # Optimized for throughput
        ) \
        .repartition(100) \
        .write_parquet("s3://processed/", try_create_dir=False)
