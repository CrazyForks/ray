## ‚úÖ **Claims Accuracy Improvements**

### **Performance Claims - CORRECTED**

**Removed Unverified Claims:**
- **‚ùå "10x larger than memory"**: Removed specific multiplier, now states "larger than available memory"
- **‚ùå "50x performance improvement"**: Changed to "Significant performance improvement" 
- **‚ùå Unqualified speedup claims**: Removed unsubstantiated performance multipliers

**Verified Claims Retained:**
- **‚úÖ "200TB+ daily processing" (ByteDance)**: Verified customer statement
- **‚úÖ "90%+ GPU utilization" (Pinterest)**: Verified production deployment
- **‚úÖ "6,000+ CPU cores" (Ant Group)**: Verified production scale
- **‚úÖ Customer quotes**: All retained quotes are actual customer statements

### **Technical Claims - VALIDATED**

**Architectural Claims (All Verified):**
- **‚úÖ Streaming execution**: Verified against `StreamingExecutor` implementation
