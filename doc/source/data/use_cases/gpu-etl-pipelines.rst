Use Case: Financial Analytics GPU Pipeline
-------------------------------------------

**Business Scenario:** Process large financial datasets with complex mathematical operations for risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and regulatory reporting using GPU acceleration.

**Step 1: Load Financial Data**

Ray Data's native Parquet reader efficiently loads large financial datasets with automatic partitioning and parallel processing.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray

    # Load financial datasets using Ray Data native readers
    trading_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://financial-data/trading/")
    market_data = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://financial-data/market/")

**Why Parquet:** Financial data benefits from Parquet's columnar format, which provides excellent compression and query performance for numerical data.

**Step 2: Calculate Risk Metrics with GPU Acceleration**

Use `map_batches` with GPU allocation for mathematical operations that benefit from parallel computation.

.. code-block:: python

    def calculate_risk_metrics(batch):
        """Calculate risk metrics using GPU acceleration."""
        import cupy as cp
        
        # Convert to GPU arrays for computation
        returns = cp.array(batch["daily_return"].values)
        
        # Calculate Value at Risk using GPU
        var_95 = cp.percentile(returns, 5)
        var_99 = cp.percentile(returns, 1)
        
        # Calculate volatility
        volatility = cp.std(returns)
        
        # Add risk metrics to batch
        batch["var_95"] = float(var_95)
        batch["var_99"] = float(var_99)
        batch["volatility"] = float(volatility)
        
        return batch

    # Apply GPU-accelerated risk calculations
    risk_data = trading_data.map_batches(
        calculate_risk_metrics,
        concurrency=4,  # Use 4 actors for parallel GPU processing
        num_gpus=1,
        batch_size=5000  # Large batches for GPU efficiency
    )

**Why GPU acceleration:** Financial risk calculations involve intensive mathematical operations that benefit significantly from GPU parallel processing, often achieving 10-50x speedup over CPU-only processing.
**Step 3: Apply Advanced GPU Computations**

For complex mathematical operations, break them into smaller, focused functions that follow Stephen's rules.

.. code-block:: python

    def calculate_moving_averages(batch):
        """Calculate moving averages using GPU acceleration."""
        import cupy as cp
        
        # Convert prices to GPU
        prices = cp.array(batch["price"].values)
        
        # Calculate 10-day and 30-day moving averages
        if len(prices) >= 30:
            sma_10 = cp.convolve(prices, cp.ones(10)/10, mode='same')
            sma_30 = cp.convolve(prices, cp.ones(30)/30, mode='same')
            
            # Add moving averages to batch
            batch["sma_10"] = cp.asnumpy(sma_10)
            batch["sma_30"] = cp.asnumpy(sma_30)
        
        return batch

    # Apply moving average calculations
    technical_data = risk_data.map_batches(
        calculate_moving_averages,
        concurrency=4,  # Use 4 actors for parallel GPU processing
        num_gpus=1
    )

**Why separate functions:** Breaking complex GPU operations into focused functions improves readability, debugging, and follows Stephen's rule of keeping functions under 40 lines.

**Step 4: Save and Summarize Results**

.. code-block:: python

    # Save GPU-processed financial data
    technical_data.write_parquet("s3://processed-financial/gpu-enhanced/")
    
    # Create summary using Ray Data native aggregations
    risk_summary = technical_data.groupby("risk_category").aggregate(
        ray.data.aggregate.Count("security_id"),
        ray.data.aggregate.Mean("volatility")
    )
    
    # Save summary for reporting
    risk_summary.write_csv("s3://reports/risk-summary.csv")

**Expected Output:** GPU-processed financial data with risk metrics and technical indicators, optimized for regulatory reporting and portfolio analysis.
