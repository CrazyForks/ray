Workflow 1: Production Batch ETL Pipeline
------------------------------------------

**Business Scenario:** Daily customer and transaction processing for enterprise data warehouse with comprehensive data quality validation.

**Complete Implementation:**

**Step 1: Data Extraction with Validation**

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from datetime import datetime

    def extract_with_validation(execution_date: str):
        """Extract data with built-in validation."""
        
        # Extract customer data with row count validation
        customers = ray.data.read_sql(
            f"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE updated_date = '{execution_date}'",
            connection_factory
        )
        
        # Validate extraction completed successfully
        customer_count = customers.count()
        assert customer_count > 0, f"No customer data found for {execution_date}"
        
        # Extract order data with schema validation
        orders = ray.data.read_parquet(f"s3://raw-data/orders/date={execution_date}/")
        
        return customers, orders, customer_count

**Step 2: Data Transformation with Quality Checks**

.. code-block:: python

    def transform_with_quality_checks(customers, orders):
        """Apply transformations with comprehensive quality validation."""
        
        def clean_and_validate_customers(batch):
            """Clean customer data with quality scoring."""
            # Data cleaning
            batch = batch.drop_duplicates(subset=["customer_id"])
            batch["email"] = batch["email"].str.lower().str.strip()
            
            # Quality validation
            email_valid = batch["email"].str.contains("@", na=False)
            phone_valid = batch["phone"].str.len() == 10
            
            # Quality scoring
            batch["data_quality_score"] = (email_valid.astype(int) + phone_valid.astype(int)) / 2
            
            return batch
        
        # Apply cleaning with quality checks
        clean_customers = customers.map_batches(clean_and_validate_customers)
        
        # Filter high-quality data
        validated_customers = clean_customers.filter(
            lambda row: row["data_quality_score"] >= 0.8
        )
        
        return validated_customers

**Step 3: Business Logic and Aggregation**

.. code-block:: python

    def apply_business_logic(customers, orders):
        """Apply business rules and create analytics."""
        
        # Join datasets using Ray Data native join
        customer_orders = customers.join(orders, on="customer_id", how="inner")
        
        # Create business metrics
        daily_metrics = customer_orders.groupby(["customer_id", "customer_segment"]).aggregate(
            ray.data.aggregate.Sum("order_amount"),
            ray.data.aggregate.Count("order_id"),
            ray.data.aggregate.Mean("order_value")
        )
        
        return daily_metrics

**Step 4: Data Loading with Monitoring**

.. code-block:: python

    def load_with_monitoring(daily_metrics, execution_date):
        """Load data to warehouse with comprehensive monitoring."""
        
        # Save to data warehouse
        daily_metrics.write_snowflake(
            table="daily_customer_metrics",
            connection_parameters=snowflake_config
        )
        
        # Create processing summary
        processing_summary = {
            "execution_date": execution_date,
            "records_processed": daily_metrics.count(),
            "processing_status": "completed",
            "processing_timestamp": datetime.now()
        }
        
        return processing_summary

**Expected Output:** Reliable daily customer metrics loaded to data warehouse with comprehensive quality validation and monitoring.

Workflow 2: Modern Cloud-Native Data Pipeline
----------------------------------------------

**Business Scenario:** Event-driven processing of user behavior data with real-time analytics and cloud-native optimization.

**Complete Implementation:**

**Step 1: Cloud-Optimized Data Loading**

.. code-block:: python

    def cloud_optimized_loading():
        """Load data with cloud-native optimization."""
        
        # Load with cloud storage optimization
        events = ray.data.read_json(
            "s3://user-events/",
            parallelism=100  # Optimize for cloud throughput
        )
        
        # Load user profiles from cloud data warehouse
        profiles = ray.data.read_bigquery(
            project_id="analytics-project",
            dataset="user_profiles"
        )
        
        return events, profiles

**Step 2: GPU-Accelerated Feature Engineering**

.. code-block:: python

    def gpu_feature_engineering(events):
        """Create features using GPU acceleration."""
        
        def compute_user_features(batch):
            """Compute user behavioral features with GPU."""
            import cupy as cp
            
            # GPU-accelerated statistical computations
            session_durations = cp.array(batch["session_duration"].values)
            
            # Calculate rolling statistics
            rolling_mean = cp.convolve(session_durations, cp.ones(5)/5, mode='same')
            
            # Add features to batch
            batch["session_trend"] = cp.asnumpy(rolling_mean)
            
            return batch
        
        # Apply GPU feature engineering
        enhanced_events = events.map_batches(
            compute_user_features,
            compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=4),
            num_gpus=1
        )
        
        return enhanced_events

**Step 3: Real-Time Analytics Preparation**

.. code-block:: python

    def prepare_realtime_analytics(enhanced_events, profiles):
        """Prepare data for real-time analytics dashboards."""
        
        # Join with user profiles
        enriched_data = enhanced_events.join(profiles, on="user_id", how="inner")
        
        # Create real-time metrics
        realtime_metrics = enriched_data.groupby(["user_segment", "event_type"]).aggregate(
            ray.data.aggregate.Count("event_id"),
            ray.data.aggregate.Mean("session_duration"),
            ray.data.aggregate.Sum("revenue_impact")
        )
        
        return realtime_metrics

**Expected Output:** Real-time analytics data optimized for dashboard consumption with GPU-enhanced features.
