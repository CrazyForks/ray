```

**Streaming Execution Engine**
The `StreamingExecutor` processes data in a fully pipelined manner, routing blocks through operators to maximize throughput under resource constraints. This enables continuous data flow without waiting for stage completion.

**Key advantages:**
* **Memory efficiency**: Process datasets 10x larger than available memory
* **Continuous processing**: No stage boundaries or intermediate materialization
* **Resource optimization**: Maintain high utilization throughout execution
* **Fault tolerance**: Individual task failures don't block pipeline progress

**Block-Based Data Model**
Data is organized into `RefBundle` objects containing Arrow-formatted blocks, with configurable sizes (default 128MB, 1GB for shuffles) that determine parallelism granularity.

**Block characteristics:**
* **Size optimization**: Configurable block sizes for workload-specific optimization
* **Arrow format**: Native Arrow data format for performance and compatibility
* **Distributed storage**: Blocks stored in Ray's distributed object store
* **Metadata tracking**: Schema and size information for intelligent optimization

**Operator Planning System**
Two-phase planning converts logical plans to physical operator DAGs, enabling optimizations like predicate pushdown and operator fusion.

**Planning phases:**
* **Logical planning**: Define operation sequence and dependencies
* **Physical planning**: Optimize execution strategy and resource allocation
* **Runtime optimization**: Dynamic adjustment based on execution feedback

**Resource Management**
`ResourceManager` provides intelligent CPU, GPU, and memory allocation with backpressure policies to prevent resource exhaustion.

**Resource management features:**
* **Intelligent allocation**: Automatic resource assignment based on operator requirements
* **Backpressure control**: Prevent memory exhaustion through intelligent throttling
* **Multi-resource support**: Coordinate CPU, GPU, and memory resources efficiently
* **Dynamic adjustment**: Adapt resource allocation based on runtime performance

Streaming Execution Model
-------------------------

**How Streaming Execution Works:**

Ray Data processes data continuously through a pipeline of operations, unlike traditional batch systems that process data in discrete stages. This fundamental architectural difference enables superior performance and resource efficiency.

    style RS_Op1 fill:#e8f5e8
    style RS_Op2 fill:#e8f5e8
    style RS_Op3 fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Key Advantages:**
