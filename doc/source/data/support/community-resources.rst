    - OS: Ubuntu 20.04
    - Cluster: Local / AWS / GCP (specify)
    
    **Problem Description:**
    Clear description of what you're trying to do and what's going wrong.
    
    **Minimal Reproducible Example:**
    ```python
    import ray
    
    # Minimal code that reproduces the issue
    ds = ray.data.range(100)
    # ... specific code causing the problem
    ```
    
    **Expected Behavior:**
    What you expected to happen.
    
    **Actual Behavior:**
    What actually happened, including error messages.

Common Issues and Solutions
---------------------------

**Performance Issues**

*Problem*: Ray Data processing is slower than expected

*Debugging steps*:

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray.data import DataContext

    # Enable detailed statistics
    ctx = DataContext.get_current()
    ctx.enable_auto_log_stats = True
    ctx.verbose_stats_logs = True

    # Run your pipeline
    result = dataset.map_batches(transform_function)
    result.materialize()

    # Analyze statistics
    print(result.stats())

*Common solutions*:
* Optimize block sizes for your workload
* Use appropriate compute strategies (tasks vs actors)
* Check resource allocation (CPU/GPU)
* Consider data locality and network transfer

**Memory Issues**

*Problem*: Out of memory errors during processing

*Debugging approach*:

.. code-block:: python

    from ray.data import DataContext

    # Reduce memory pressure
    ctx = DataContext.get_current()
    ctx.target_max_block_size = 64 * 1024 * 1024  # 64MB blocks
    ctx.eager_free = True

    # Use streaming execution
    result = dataset.map_batches(transform_function, batch_size=100)

* :ref:`Memory Management Best Practices <data-quality-governance>`

**Data Source Issues**

*Problem*: Cannot connect to data source or read files

*Common checks*:
* Verify credentials and permissions
* Test connectivity outside Ray Data
* Check file paths and formats
* Review Ray Data connector documentation

*Resources*:
* :ref:`Data Sources Documentation <loading_data>`
* :ref:`Integration Examples <integration-examples>`
