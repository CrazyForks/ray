Advanced Ray Data Operations Optimization
====================================

This guide covers optimization strategies for advanced Ray Data operations including shuffles, joins, groupby operations, and other complex transformations that require special performance considerations.

**For Data Scientists and Engineers: What Makes Operations "Advanced"?**

Some Ray Data operations are more complex because they need to reorganize data across your entire cluster, similar to wide transformations in Spark:

- **Simple operations** (like map_batches): Similar to Spark narrow transformations - each partition can be processed independently without data shuffling
- **Advanced operations** (like shuffle, groupby, join): Similar to Spark wide transformations - require data movement between partitions/nodes

If you've worked with Spark, you'll recognize these as the operations that trigger stage boundaries and require shuffles. In Ray Data, these operations require more careful optimization because they involve network communication and coordination across the cluster.

Advanced Operations Overview
============================

Advanced Ray Data operations typically involve data movement across the cluster and require careful optimization.

**Why Advanced Operations Need Special Attention:**

Unlike simple transformations that process data in place, advanced operations often require:

1. **Data redistribution**: Moving data between different computers in your cluster
2. **Coordination**: Multiple tasks working together to achieve a common goal
3. **Memory management**: Storing intermediate results during complex operations
4. **Network communication**: Transferring data across network connections

This makes them potentially more expensive than simple operations, but also more powerful for complex data processing tasks.

Shuffle Operations Optimization
==============================

Understanding Shuffle Performance
--------------------------------

Shuffle operations redistribute data across the cluster and are often performance bottlenecks. Understanding shuffle performance is critical because these operations can dominate your pipeline's execution time.

**Why Shuffles are Expensive:**

Shuffle operations are fundamentally different from other Ray Data operations because they require data movement across the entire cluster:

1. **Network Transfer**: Data must be sent between nodes, limited by network bandwidth
2. **Serialization**: Data must be serialized for network transfer and deserialized on arrival
3. **Coordination**: All tasks must coordinate to ensure data ends up in the right partitions
4. **Memory Pressure**: Intermediate shuffle data consumes significant object store memory

The performance impact scales with both data size and cluster size - larger datasets and more nodes generally mean more expensive shuffles.

**How Ray Data Shuffle Architecture Works:**

Ray Data shuffle operations follow a two-phase process similar to MapReduce or Spark shuffles:

**Phase 1 - Map/Partition:**
- Each input task reads its assigned blocks
- Tasks partition their data based on the shuffle key (for groupby) or randomly (for random_shuffle)
- Partitioned data is written to intermediate storage or sent directly to destination tasks

**Phase 2 - Reduce/Combine:**  
- Reduce tasks collect all data for their assigned partition
- Data is combined, sorted, or aggregated as needed for the operation
- Final results are written as output blocks

**Shuffle Performance Characteristics:**

Shuffles are expensive because they require:
- **All-to-all communication**: Every input task potentially sends data to every output task
- **Network bandwidth**: Limited by cluster network capacity
- **Memory coordination**: Intermediate data must be stored and managed
- **Synchronization**: All map tasks must complete before reduce tasks can start

.. testcode::

    # Simple shuffle operation
    result = ds.random_shuffle()

Push-Based Shuffle Optimization
------------------------------

Ray Data supports push-based shuffle for better performance:

**Configuring Push-Based Shuffle:**

Push-based shuffle is an alternative shuffle algorithm that provides better memory efficiency and handles data skew more effectively than the default approach. It works by having tasks push their output directly to the destination nodes rather than writing to intermediate storage.

**Benefits of Push-Based Shuffle:**
- Better memory efficiency by reducing intermediate data storage
- Reduced network overhead through direct data transfer
- Better handling of skewed data by avoiding hot spots
- Improved performance for large shuffles

**Enable Push-Based Shuffle:**

.. testcode::

    import os
    
    # Enable push-based shuffle
    os.environ["RAY_DATA_PUSH_BASED_SHUFFLE"] = "1"

**Configure Ray Data for Push-Based Shuffle:**

.. testcode::

    # Optimize Ray Data settings for push-based shuffle
    ctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()
    ctx.target_max_block_size = 128 * 1024 * 1024  # 128MB blocks
    ctx.execution_options.resource_limits.cpu = None  # Use all CPUs

**Run Shuffle Operations:**

.. testcode::

    # Shuffle operations will now use push-based shuffle
    shuffled = ds.random_shuffle()

**Shuffle Memory Optimization**

.. testcode::

    def memory_optimized_shuffle(ds, target_memory_gb=4):
        """Perform shuffle with memory constraints."""
        
        # Calculate optimal number of output blocks
        data_size_gb = ds.stats().total_bytes / (1024**3)
        
        # Target block size based on available memory
        target_block_size_mb = (target_memory_gb * 1024) // 8  # Use 1/8 of memory per block
        optimal_blocks = max(1, int((data_size_gb * 1024) / target_block_size_mb))
        
        print(f"Memory-optimized shuffle:")
        print(f"  Data size: {data_size_gb:.2f}GB")
        print(f"  Target memory: {target_memory_gb}GB")
        print(f"  Optimal blocks: {optimal_blocks}")
        
        # Configure context for memory efficiency
        ctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()
        original_max_block_size = ctx.target_max_block_size
        
        try:
            ctx.target_max_block_size = target_block_size_mb * 1024 * 1024
            
            # Perform shuffle
            result = ds.random_shuffle()
            
            return result
            
        finally:
            # Restore original settings
            ctx.target_max_block_size = original_max_block_size
    
    # Usage
    shuffled = memory_optimized_shuffle(ds, target_memory_gb=8)

GroupBy Operations Optimization
==============================

Efficient GroupBy Implementation
-------------------------------

GroupBy operations can be optimized through pre-sorting and partitioning:

.. testcode::

    def optimized_groupby(ds, group_column, agg_functions):
        """Optimized groupby with pre-sorting."""
        
        print(f"Optimizing groupby on '{group_column}'")
        
        # Strategy 1: Pre-sort data for better groupby performance
        print("Step 1: Pre-sorting data...")
        sorted_ds = ds.sort(group_column)
        
        # Strategy 2: Use appropriate block size for groupby
        ctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()
        original_block_size = ctx.target_max_block_size
        
        try:
            # Larger blocks for groupby efficiency
            ctx.target_max_block_size = 256 * 1024 * 1024  # 256MB
            
            print("Step 2: Performing groupby...")
            grouped = sorted_ds.groupby(group_column).agg(agg_functions)
            
            return grouped
            
        finally:
            ctx.target_max_block_size = original_block_size
    
    # Example usage
    agg_funcs = {
        "value": ["mean", "sum", "count"],
        "amount": ["max", "min"]
    }
    
    result = optimized_groupby(ds, "category", agg_funcs)

**Hash-Based GroupBy Optimization**

.. testcode::

    def hash_partitioned_groupby(ds, group_column, num_partitions=None):
        """GroupBy with hash partitioning for better performance."""
        
        if num_partitions is None:
            num_partitions = int(ray.cluster_resources().get("CPU", 4)) * 2
        
        print(f"Hash-partitioned groupby with {num_partitions} partitions")
        
        def hash_partition_function(batch):
            """Partition data by hash of group column."""
            import pandas as pd
            
            df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
            
            # Add partition column based on hash
            df["_partition"] = df[group_column].apply(
                lambda x: hash(str(x)) % num_partitions
            )
            
            return df.to_dict("list")
        
        # Step 1: Add partition column
        partitioned = ds.map_batches(hash_partition_function, batch_format="pandas")
        
        # Step 2: Repartition by hash
        def partition_filter(partition_id):
            def filter_func(batch):
                mask = [p == partition_id for p in batch["_partition"]]
                return {k: [v for v, m in zip(values, mask) if m] 
                       for k, values in batch.items() if k != "_partition"}
            return filter_func
        
        # Step 3: Process each partition separately
        partition_results = []
        for partition_id in range(num_partitions):
            partition_data = partitioned.map_batches(partition_filter(partition_id))
            partition_grouped = partition_data.groupby(group_column).count()
            partition_results.append(partition_grouped)
        
        # Step 4: Union results
        final_result = partition_results[0]
        for partition_result in partition_results[1:]:
            final_result = final_result.union(partition_result)
        
        return final_result
    
    # Usage
    result = hash_partitioned_groupby(ds, "user_id", num_partitions=16)

Join Operations Optimization
============================

Broadcast Join Optimization
---------------------------

For joins where one dataset is much smaller, use broadcast joins:

.. testcode::

    def broadcast_join_optimization(large_ds, small_ds, join_key, broadcast_threshold_mb=100):
        """Optimize join using broadcast strategy for small datasets."""
        
        # Check if small dataset qualifies for broadcast
        small_size_mb = small_ds.stats().total_bytes / (1024**2)
        
        if small_size_mb <= broadcast_threshold_mb:
            print(f"Using broadcast join (small dataset: {small_size_mb:.1f}MB)")
            
            # Materialize small dataset for broadcast
            small_materialized = small_ds.materialize()
            
            # Convert to dictionary for fast lookup
            def create_lookup_dict(ds, key_column):
                """Create lookup dictionary from dataset."""
                lookup = {}
                for batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=1000):
                    for i, key in enumerate(batch[key_column]):
                        row = {col: batch[col][i] for col in batch.keys()}
                        lookup[key] = row
                return lookup
            
            lookup_dict = create_lookup_dict(small_materialized, join_key)
            
            # Broadcast join function
            def broadcast_join_func(batch):
                """Perform broadcast join using lookup dictionary."""
                results = []
                
                for i, key in enumerate(batch[join_key]):
                    large_row = {col: batch[col][i] for col in batch.keys()}
                    
                    if key in lookup_dict:
                        # Merge rows
                        small_row = lookup_dict[key]
                        merged_row = {**large_row, **{f"right_{k}": v for k, v in small_row.items()}}
                        results.append(merged_row)
                
                # Convert back to batch format
                if results:
                    result_batch = {}
                    for key in results[0].keys():
                        result_batch[key] = [row[key] for row in results]
                    return result_batch
                else:
                    return {col: [] for col in batch.keys()}
            
            return large_ds.map_batches(broadcast_join_func)
        
        else:
            print(f"Dataset too large for broadcast ({small_size_mb:.1f}MB), using standard join")
            return large_ds.join(small_ds, key=join_key)
    
    # Usage
    result = broadcast_join_optimization(
        large_dataset, 
        small_lookup_table, 
        join_key="user_id",
        broadcast_threshold_mb=50
    )

**Co-partitioned Join Optimization**

.. testcode::

    def copartitioned_join(left_ds, right_ds, join_key, num_partitions=None):
        """Optimize join by co-partitioning both datasets."""
        
        if num_partitions is None:
            num_partitions = int(ray.cluster_resources().get("CPU", 4))
        
        print(f"Co-partitioned join with {num_partitions} partitions")
        
        def partition_by_join_key(ds, key_column, num_parts):
            """Partition dataset by join key."""
            
            def add_partition_id(batch):
                partition_ids = []
                for key in batch[key_column]:
                    partition_id = hash(str(key)) % num_parts
                    partition_ids.append(partition_id)
                
                return {**batch, "_partition_id": partition_ids}
            
            return ds.map_batches(add_partition_id)
        
        # Partition both datasets by join key
        left_partitioned = partition_by_join_key(left_ds, join_key, num_partitions)
        right_partitioned = partition_by_join_key(right_ds, join_key, num_partitions)
        
        # Join each partition separately
        partition_results = []
        
        for partition_id in range(num_partitions):
            # Filter to partition
            left_partition = left_partitioned.filter(
                lambda row: row["_partition_id"] == partition_id
            )
            right_partition = right_partitioned.filter(

    # Usage
    result = copartitioned_join(orders_ds, customers_ds, "customer_id", num_partitions=8)

Sort Operations Optimization
===========================

Sample-Based Sorting
--------------------

For large datasets, use sample-based sorting for better performance:

.. testcode::

    def sample_based_sort(ds, sort_column, sample_fraction=0.01):
        """Optimize sorting using sampling for large datasets."""
        
        print(f"Sample-based sort on '{sort_column}'")

        print("Step 1: Sampling data for partition boundaries...")
        sampled = ds.random_sample(sample_fraction)
        sample_values = []
        
        for batch in sampled.iter_batches(batch_size=1000):
            sample_values.extend(batch[sort_column])
        
        # Sort sample values and create partition boundaries
        sample_values.sort()
        num_partitions = int(ray.cluster_resources().get("CPU", 4))
        
        boundaries = []
        step = len(sample_values) // num_partitions
        for i in range(1, num_partitions):
            boundaries.append(sample_values[i * step])
        
        print(f"Step 2: Created {len(boundaries)} partition boundaries")
        
        # Step 2: Partition data based on boundaries
        def partition_by_boundaries(batch):
            """Partition batch based on sort boundaries."""

            partitioned_data = [[] for _ in range(num_partitions)]
            
            for i, value in enumerate(batch[sort_column]):
                partition_id = bisect.bisect_left(boundaries, value)
                partition_id = min(partition_id, num_partitions - 1)
                
                row = {col: batch[col][i] for col in batch.keys()}
                partitioned_data[partition_id].append(row)

        # This is a simplified version - actual implementation would be more complex
        sorted_ds = ds.sort(sort_column)
        
        return sorted_ds
    
    # Usage
    sorted_result = sample_based_sort(large_dataset, "timestamp", sample_fraction=0.005)

Repartition Operations Optimization
==================================

Intelligent Repartitioning
--------------------------

Optimize repartitioning based on data characteristics:

.. testcode::

    def intelligent_repartition(ds, target_use_case="balanced"):
        """Intelligently repartition based on use case."""
        
        current_stats = ds.stats()
