## Core Components

The Ray Data SQL API consists of several interconnected subsystems that work together to provide comprehensive SQL functionality. Each component is designed for distributed execution and follows Ray's architectural patterns for scalability and fault tolerance.

### 1. Query Processing Pipeline

The SQL engine implements a sophisticated multi-phase query processing pipeline that combines traditional SQL processing techniques with Ray-specific optimizations. This pipeline ensures efficient execution while maintaining SQL standard compliance.

#### Pipeline Overview

The query processing follows these distinct phases:

1. **Registration Phase**: Datasets are registered as named tables with automatic schema inference
2. **Parsing Phase**: SQL strings are converted to Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) using SQLGlot
3. **Optimization Phase**: Multiple optimization passes improve query performance
4. **Planning Phase**: Logical execution plans are generated for complex queries
5. **Execution Phase**: ASTs are converted to Ray Dataset operations and executed
6. **Materialization Phase**: Results are collected and returned as Ray Datasets

Each phase is designed to be independently optimizable and can be extended with additional functionality.

#### Phase 1: Registration and Discovery
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Registry as DatasetRegistry
    participant Schema as SchemaManager
    participant Dataset as Ray Dataset

    User->>Registry: register_table("users", dataset)
    Registry->>Dataset: Validate dataset type
    Registry->>Schema: infer_schema_from_dataset()
    Schema->>Dataset: take(10) # Sample for inference
    Dataset-->>Schema: Sample rows
    Schema->>Schema: Analyze types and create TableSchema
    Schema-->>Registry: Schema metadata
    Registry-->>User: Table registered
```

#### Phase 2: Query Execution
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Engine as RaySQL
    participant Parser as SQLParser
    participant Optimizer as ASTOptimizer
    participant Executor as QueryExecutor
    participant Result as Ray Dataset

    User->>Engine: sql("SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 25")
    Engine->>Parser: parse(query)
    Parser-->>Engine: SQLGlot AST
    Engine->>Optimizer: optimize(ast)
    Optimizer-->>Engine: Optimized AST
    Engine->>Executor: execute(ast)
    Executor->>Executor: Apply operations in SQL order
    Executor-->>Engine: Result dataset
    Engine-->>User: Ray Dataset
```

#### Detailed Phase Analysis

**Registration Phase**: This phase establishes the mapping between SQL table names and Ray Datasets. The DatasetRegistry maintains this mapping while the SchemaManager performs automatic type inference by sampling data. This phase is critical for query validation and optimization, as it provides the metadata necessary for type checking and predicate pushdown.

**Parsing Phase**: SQL queries are parsed using SQLGlot, a robust SQL parser that supports multiple SQL dialects. The parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the query structure in a format suitable for analysis and optimization. Error handling during this phase provides detailed syntax error messages with suggestions for correction.

**Optimization Phase**: Multiple optimization passes are applied to the AST to improve query performance. This includes both SQLGlot's built-in optimizations (constant folding, predicate simplification) and custom Ray-specific optimizations (predicate pushdown to dataset level, join reordering based on data statistics).

**Planning Phase**: For complex queries, a logical execution plan is generated that describes the optimal order of operations. This phase considers factors like data locality, network bandwidth, and available compute resources to minimize execution time.

**Execution Phase**: The optimized AST is converted into a series of Ray Dataset operations. Each SQL operation is mapped to corresponding Ray Dataset methods, with compiled expressions handling the detailed computation logic.

**Materialization Phase**: Results are collected from distributed computation and returned as Ray Datasets, maintaining lazy evaluation semantics until the user explicitly requests data materialization.

### 2. Component Architecture

The system architecture follows a layered design with clear separation of concerns. Each layer builds upon the previous one, creating a robust and maintainable system.

#### DatasetRegistry and SchemaManager

The DatasetRegistry serves as the central catalog for all available datasets, providing a SQL-like table abstraction over Ray Datasets. It works closely with the SchemaManager to maintain comprehensive metadata about each registered table.
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DatasetRegistry {
        -_tables: Dict[str, Dataset]
        -schema_manager: SchemaManager
        +register(name, dataset)
        +get(name): Dataset
        +list_tables(): List[str]
        +clear()
    }

    class SchemaManager {
        -_schemas: Dict[str, TableSchema]
        +infer_schema_from_dataset(name, dataset)
        +get_schema(name): TableSchema
        +register_schema(name, schema)
    }

    class TableSchema {
        +name: str
        +columns: Dict[str, ColumnInfo]
        +add_column(name, type)
        +get_column(name): ColumnInfo
    }

    DatasetRegistry --> SchemaManager
    SchemaManager --> TableSchema
```

**Key Features of DatasetRegistry:**
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Multiple concurrent registrations and lookups are safely handled
- **Automatic Validation**: Input datasets are validated for type correctness and Ray Dataset compliance
- **Name Resolution**: SQL table names are resolved to actual Ray Dataset objects with case sensitivity options
- **Lifecycle Management**: Tables can be registered, updated, and removed dynamically during execution

**SchemaManager Capabilities:**
- **Sample-Based Inference**: Uses statistical sampling to infer column types without full dataset scans
- **Type Mapping**: Comprehensive mapping from Python types to SQL types with support for complex nested structures
- **Schema Caching**: Inferred schemas are cached to avoid repeated inference operations
- **Consistency Validation**: Schema changes are detected and validated across query executions

#### Query Execution Components

The execution layer contains specialized components that handle different aspects of SQL query execution. Each component is optimized for specific operation types while maintaining compatibility with the overall execution framework.
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class QueryExecutor {
        +registry: DatasetRegistry
        +config: SQLConfig
        +execute(ast): Dataset
        -_execute_simple_query(ast)
        -_execute_group_by_query(ast)
    }

    class JoinHandler {
        +apply_joins(dataset, ast, registry)
        +apply_single_join(left, join_ast, registry)
        -_extract_join_info(join_ast)
    }

    class ProjectionAnalyzer {
        +analyze_projections(exprs, dataset)
        -_analyze_single_expression(expr)
        -_handle_star_expression()
    }

    class ExpressionCompiler {
        +compile(expr): Callable
        -_compile_column(expr)
        -_compile_arithmetic(expr)
        -_compile_comparison(expr)
    }

    QueryExecutor --> JoinHandler
    QueryExecutor --> ProjectionAnalyzer
    ProjectionAnalyzer --> ExpressionCompiler
```

**Component Responsibilities:**

**QueryExecutor**: Acts as the central coordinator for query execution, managing the overall flow from AST to result. It determines whether a query requires simple processing or complex aggregation handling, and dispatches to appropriate execution paths.

**JoinHandler**: Specializes in processing JOIN operations of all types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER). It handles the complex logic of column validation, join condition parsing, and mapping SQL JOIN semantics to Ray Dataset join operations.

**ProjectionAnalyzer**: Responsible for analyzing SELECT clauses and generating the appropriate column projections. It handles everything from simple column selection to complex expressions involving arithmetic, functions, and literals.

**ExpressionCompiler**: The core compilation engine that converts SQL expressions into Python callable functions. It supports a wide range of expression types and generates optimized code for distributed execution.

## SQL Evaluation Order

The engine strictly follows standard SQL evaluation semantics, ensuring compatibility with existing SQL knowledge while optimizing for Ray's distributed execution model. This adherence to standards is crucial for user adoption and correctness.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[FROM clause] --> B[JOIN operations]
    B --> C[WHERE filtering]
    C --> D[GROUP BY aggregation]
    D --> E[HAVING filtering]
    E --> F[SELECT projection]
    F --> G[ORDER BY sorting]
    G --> H[LIMIT row restriction]

    subgraph "Ray Dataset Operations"
        A1[Dataset lookup from registry]
        B1[dataset.join() with Ray join API]
        C1[dataset.filter() with compiled predicates]
        D1[dataset.groupby().aggregate()]
        E1[dataset.filter() on aggregated results]
        F1[dataset.map() with compiled expressions]
        G1[dataset.sort() with sort keys]
        H1[dataset.limit() with row count]
    end

    A -.-> A1
    B -.-> B1
    C -.-> C1
    D -.-> D1
    E -.-> E1
    F -.-> F1
    G -.-> G1
    H -.-> H1
```

### Execution Order Details

The SQL evaluation order is implemented through a carefully orchestrated sequence of Ray Dataset operations:

1. **FROM Clause Processing**: Table names are resolved to Ray Datasets through the DatasetRegistry. This phase validates table existence and retrieves the base datasets for query execution.

2. **JOIN Operations**: If the query contains JOINs, they are processed left-to-right as they appear in the SQL. Each JOIN operation creates a new Ray Dataset that combines data from the participating tables.

3. **WHERE Filtering**: Filter conditions are compiled into Python functions and applied using Ray Dataset's filter() method. Predicate pushdown optimizations may move some filters to earlier stages.

4. **GROUP BY Aggregation**: Grouping operations use Ray Dataset's groupby() functionality, with custom aggregation functions compiled from SQL aggregate expressions.

5. **HAVING Filtering**: Post-aggregation filters are applied to the grouped results, enabling complex analytical queries.

6. **SELECT Projection**: Column selections and computed expressions are applied using Ray Dataset's map() method with compiled expression functions.

7. **ORDER BY Sorting**: Sorting operations use Ray Dataset's sort() method with appropriate sort keys and ordering specifications.

8. **LIMIT Restriction**: Row count limitations are applied using Ray Dataset's limit() method, enabling efficient result set management.

### Ray Dataset Operation Mapping

Each SQL operation is carefully mapped to equivalent Ray Dataset operations while preserving SQL semantics:

- **Table Scans**: Ray Dataset objects from the registry
- **Joins**: `dataset.join(other, on=columns, join_type=type)`
- **Filters**: `dataset.filter(lambda row: compiled_predicate(row))`
- **Aggregations**: `dataset.groupby(columns).aggregate(compiled_agg_functions)`
- **Projections**: `dataset.map(lambda row: compiled_projection(row))`
- **Sorting**: `dataset.sort(key=compiled_sort_key, descending=desc)`
- **Limits**: `dataset.limit(count)`

## Expression Compilation System

The expression compilation system represents one of the most sophisticated aspects of the Ray Data SQL API. It transforms SQL expressions into highly optimized Python functions that can execute efficiently in Ray's distributed environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "SQL Expression Types"
        A[Column References]
        B[Arithmetic Operations]
        C[Comparison Operations]
        D[Logical Operations]
        E[String Functions]
        F[Aggregate Functions]
        G[Literal Values]
    end

    subgraph "Compilation Process"
        H[SQLGlot AST] --> I[ExpressionCompiler]
        I --> J[Type Analysis]
        J --> K[Python Lambda Generation]
    end

    subgraph "Execution"
        K --> L[Row Dictionary Input]
        L --> M[Computed Value Output]
    end

    A --> H
    B --> H
    C --> H
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

### Compilation Process Details

The ExpressionCompiler operates through several sophisticated phases:

1. **AST Analysis**: SQLGlot expressions are analyzed to determine their type and dependencies
2. **Type Inference**: Column types are inferred from schema information to enable type-safe operations
3. **Optimization**: Constant folding and other optimizations are applied at the expression level
4. **Code Generation**: Python lambda functions are generated with appropriate error handling
5. **Validation**: Generated functions are validated for correctness and performance characteristics

### Expression Type Support

The compiler supports a comprehensive range of SQL expression types:

**Column References**: Simple and qualified column names with case-sensitive handling

- `STDDEV()`, `VARIANCE()` for statistical analysis
- Custom aggregate function support

### Expression Compilation Examples

```python
# SQL: SELECT name, age + 5 AS age_plus_5 FROM users WHERE age > 25

# Column reference compilation:
# "name" -> lambda row: safe_get_column(row, "name", case_sensitive=False)

# Arithmetic expression compilation with null handling:
# "age + 5" -> lambda row: (row["age"] + 5) if row["age"] is not None else None

# Comparison expression with type checking:
# "age > 25" -> lambda row: row["age"] > 25 if row["age"] is not None else None

# Complex expression with multiple operations:
# "UPPER(name) LIKE 'A%'" -> lambda row: str(row["name"]).upper().startswith('A')
#                            if row["name"] is not None else None
```

### Performance Optimizations

The compilation system includes several performance optimizations:

**Constant Folding**: Compile-time evaluation of constant expressions
```python
# "5 + 3" -> lambda row: 8  (evaluated at compile time)
```

**Type Specialization**: Type-specific code generation for better performance
```python
# For integer columns: direct arithmetic without type checking
# For mixed types: type coercion with validation
```

**Null Handling Optimization**: Efficient null propagation patterns
```python
# Early null detection to avoid unnecessary computation
# Batch null checking for multiple column access
```

## Join Processing Architecture

The join processing system represents a critical component that bridges SQL JOIN semantics with Ray Dataset's distributed join capabilities. This system handles the complex mapping between SQL's declarative JOIN syntax and Ray's imperative join operations while maintaining performance and correctness.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "SQL JOIN Types"
        A[INNER JOIN]
        B[LEFT JOIN]
        C[RIGHT JOIN]
        D[FULL OUTER JOIN]
    end

    subgraph "Ray Dataset Join API"
        E[join_type='inner']
        F[join_type='left_outer']
        G[join_type='right_outer']
        H[join_type='full_outer']
    end

    subgraph "Join Processing Steps"
        I[Extract table names]
        J[Resolve datasets from registry]
        K[Parse ON condition]
        L[Extract join columns]
        M[Validate column existence]
        N[Execute Ray Dataset join]
    end

    A --> E
    B --> F
    C --> G
    D --> H

    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I

    I --> J --> K --> L --> M --> N
```

### Join Processing Deep Dive

The join processing system handles several complex challenges inherent in distributed join operations:

**Join Type Mapping**: SQL JOIN types are mapped to Ray Dataset join types with careful consideration for semantic equivalence:
- `INNER JOIN` → `join_type='inner'`: Only rows with matching join keys from both datasets
- `LEFT JOIN` → `join_type='left_outer'`: All rows from left dataset, matching rows from right
- `RIGHT JOIN` → `join_type='right_outer'`: All rows from right dataset, matching rows from left
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` → `join_type='full_outer'`: All rows from both datasets with nulls for non-matches

**Column Resolution**: The system performs intelligent column resolution to handle various JOIN syntax patterns:
- Qualified column names (e.g., `users.id = orders.user_id`)
- Unqualified column names with automatic table inference
- Column name conflicts resolution with configurable suffixes
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive column matching

**Performance Optimization**: Join operations are optimized based on data characteristics:
- **Broadcast Joins**: Small datasets are broadcasted to all nodes for efficiency
- **Shuffle Joins**: Large datasets use shuffle-based joins with optimal partitioning
- **Partition-Aware Joins**: Pre-partitioned data leverages existing partitioning schemes
- **Join Reordering**: Multi-table joins are reordered based on estimated cardinalities

**Memory Management**: Join operations handle memory constraints through:
- **Streaming Joins**: Large joins are processed in streaming fashion to control memory usage
- **Spill-to-Disk**: Memory pressure triggers automatic spilling of intermediate results
- **Chunk Processing**: Very large joins are processed in manageable chunks
- **Resource Monitoring**: Dynamic resource allocation based on available cluster capacity

## Schema Inference System

The schema inference system provides automatic discovery and management of table schemas, eliminating the need for manual schema definition while ensuring type safety and query optimization. This system is essential for usability and performance in distributed environments where schema information drives optimization decisions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Ray Dataset] --> B[Sample Data]
    B --> C{Empty Dataset?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Skip Inference]
    C -->|No| E[Take Sample Rows]
    E --> F[Analyze Each Column]
    F --> G[Map Python Types to SQL Types]

    subgraph "Type Mapping Rules"
        H[None → NULL]
        I[bool → BOOLEAN]
        J[int → INTEGER]
        K[float → DOUBLE]
        L[str → VARCHAR]
        M[other → VARCHAR]
    end

    I --> N
    J --> N
    K --> N
    L --> N
    M --> N

    N --> O[Register Schema]
```

### Schema Inference Implementation

The schema inference process involves several sophisticated techniques to handle the complexity of distributed data:

**Sampling Strategy**: The system uses intelligent sampling to gather representative data:
- **Statistical Sampling**: Random sampling ensures representative type distribution
- **Stratified Sampling**: For partitioned datasets, samples from each partition
- **Adaptive Sampling**: Sample size adjusts based on data characteristics and variance
- **Minimal Impact**: Sampling is designed to minimize performance impact on large datasets

**Type Inference Rules**: Comprehensive type mapping handles diverse data scenarios:
- **Primitive Types**: Direct mapping from Python types to SQL types
- **Nested Structures**: Complex types like lists and dictionaries are handled appropriately
- **Null Handling**: Null values don't override inferred types from non-null samples
- **Mixed Types**: Columns with mixed types default to flexible VARCHAR representation
- **Temporal Types**: Date and timestamp detection with format inference

**Schema Evolution**: The system handles schema changes gracefully:
- **Version Tracking**: Schema versions are tracked to detect changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: New schemas maintain compatibility with existing queries
- **Incremental Updates**: Schema updates only affect changed columns
- **Conflict Resolution**: Schema conflicts are resolved with configurable strategies

**Performance Considerations**: Schema inference is optimized for large-scale data:
- **Lazy Inference**: Schemas are inferred only when needed
- **Parallel Processing**: Inference across multiple partitions happens in parallel
- **Caching**: Inferred schemas are cached to avoid repeated computation
- **Resource Bounds**: Inference operations have configurable resource limits

## Optimization Pipeline

The optimization pipeline represents a multi-layered approach to query optimization, combining traditional database optimization techniques with Ray-specific optimizations. This pipeline is crucial for achieving high performance on distributed workloads and large datasets.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Original SQL AST] --> B[SQLGlot Built-in Optimizations]
    B --> C[Predicate Pushdown]
    C --> D[Constant Folding]
    D --> E[Dead Code Elimination]
    E --> F[Custom Ray Data Optimizations]
    F --> G[Ray-specific Predicate Pushdown]
    G --> H[Join Reordering]
    H --> I[Optimized AST]

    subgraph "Optimization Benefits"
        J[Reduced Data Movement]

- **Aggregate Pushdown**: Moves aggregations closer to data sources
- **Projection Elimination**: Removes unnecessary column projections

## Configuration System

The configuration system provides comprehensive control over SQL engine behavior, enabling fine-tuning for different workloads, environments, and performance requirements. The system follows a hierarchical configuration model with sensible defaults and extensive customization options.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SQLConfig {

        +enable_logical_planning: bool
    }

    class LogLevel {
        ERROR
        INFO
        DEBUG
    }

    SQLConfig --> LogLevel
```

        P[Available Tables/Columns]
    end

    C --> N
    E --> O
    G --> P
    I --> N
    L --> N
```

### Error Classification and Handling

The system implements a comprehensive error taxonomy with specific handling strategies:

**Syntax Errors**: Issues with SQL query structure and grammar
- **Parse Errors**: Invalid SQL syntax detected during parsing phase
- **Lexical Errors**: Unrecognized tokens or invalid characters
